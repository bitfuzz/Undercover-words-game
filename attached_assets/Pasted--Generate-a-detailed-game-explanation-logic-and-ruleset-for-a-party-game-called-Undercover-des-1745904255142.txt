"Generate a detailed game explanation, logic, and ruleset for a party game called *Undercover*, designed for **4 to 20 players**. The game is played offline (in person), and an app or interface is used **only for assigning roles and eliminating players**, not for gameplay mechanics like clue-giving or voting. The interface should include a button to eliminate a player, after which their role is revealed. There are only three types of roles: *Undercover*, *Civilian*, and *Mr. White* — no other special roles should be included. Focus on simplicity, hidden identity, and deduction.

The generated output should include the following clearly defined sections:

---

### 1. **Overview of the Game**

- *Undercover* is a hidden-role social deduction game for 4–20 players.
- Each player is secretly assigned one of three roles: **Undercover**, **Civilian**, or **Mr. White**.
- The objective varies by role:
  - **Civilians** must identify and eliminate all *Undercover* and *Mr. White* players.
  - **Undercover** players must blend in and be the last players standing.
  - **Mr. White** has no clue word and must improvise and deceive the others; they win if they survive to the final 2 or guess the civilian word if eliminated.

---

### 2. **Roles and Their Functions**

- **Civilian**:
  - The majority role.
  - Knows the secret word (e.g., "apple").
  - Must figure out who the Undercover and Mr. White players are and vote them out.
  
- **Undercover**:
  - Knows a slightly different word from the civilian word (e.g., "banana" instead of "apple").
  - Tries to avoid suspicion and eliminate civilians.
  
- **Mr. White**:
  - Receives no word at all.
  - Must pretend to know the word and deceive others.
  - Wins if:
    - All civilians and Undercover players are eliminated except one.
    - OR if Mr. White is eliminated but correctly guesses the civilian word.

---

### 3. **Game Setup**

- Each player accesses the interface privately and taps a “Start” button to receive their secret role.
- The system randomly assigns:
  - 1–3 Undercover players depending on total player count.
  - 1 Mr. White.
  - The remaining players are Civilians.
- Civilians and Undercover players receive **similar but not identical words** (e.g., "Cat" vs "Tiger").
- Mr. White is told, "You are Mr. White. You do not have a word."

Example role distribution:
- 4–6 players: 1 Undercover, 1 Mr. White, rest Civilians.
- 7–10 players: 2 Undercover, 1 Mr. White.
- 11–20 players: 3 Undercover, 1 Mr. White.

### 4. **Gameplay Mechanics**

- **No in-game clue-giving or online interaction** — the core gameplay is **offline discussion and deduction**.
- Players may say a single word each turn to describe their clue, or engage in free conversation — this happens verbally among the group.
- After each round of discussion, players **vote offline** to eliminate someone.
- The eliminated player is selected via the interface: the game organizer taps on the player's name and presses the **"Eliminate"** button.
- Upon elimination, the player's role is revealed **instantly on-screen**.

---


### 5. **Elimination Logic**

- After players vote **offline** through discussion and consensus, one player is selected for elimination.
- The game interface includes a simple **"Eliminate Player"** button.
  - The host or organizer selects the name of the chosen player from a list.
  - Pressing the "Eliminate Player" button immediately **reveals the role** of the selected player on-screen.
- If the eliminated player is **Mr. White**:
  - They are **prompted offline** to guess the civilian word.
  - If the guess is correct, **Mr. White wins instantly**.
  - If the guess is incorrect, the game continues as normal.
- Eliminated players take no further part in the game but may observe silently.

---


### 6. **Victory Conditions**

- **Civilians Win** when all *Undercover* and *Mr. White* players are eliminated.
- **Undercover Win** when they equal or outnumber the remaining players.
- **Mr. White Wins** if:
  - They guess the civilian word upon being eliminated.
  - OR they survive to the final two players.

---

### 7. **Interface Requirements**

- A minimal app or web interface should:
  - Allow each player to tap to reveal their secret role.
  - Have a button to **eliminate a player**, showing a confirmation modal.
  - Display the eliminated player's **role** after confirmation.
  - Optionally track who has been eliminated and current player count.
  - Ensure that the civilian and undercover words are generated as a similar pair (e.g., "pencil" vs. "pen").

---

### 8. **Design Considerations**

- All interaction is human-to-human. The app is only a **tool for role distribution and elimination**.
- Emphasize offline social deduction — lying, bluffing, deduction, and teamwork are encouraged.
- The app or host should **never** display the full word list or allow roles to be viewed twice.
